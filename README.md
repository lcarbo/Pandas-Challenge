# Pandas-Challenge

In this challenge I analyzed in-game purchase data for Heroes of Pymoli to identify trends in player demographics and item popularity. 

Based on my analysis, we can conclude the following: 

1) The game is most popular with males, and players aged 20 to 24 years old
2) Players in the 35 to 39yo age range spend the most per person, though the 20 to 24 yo age range has the highest gross value of purchases
3) The 'Final Critic' item is both the most popular item and the item that has accrued the most revenue
